intro: "These are the slides from my presentation at the April Atlanta R User meetup.  I wanted to share the slides because they use the ioslides Rmarkdown template to directly embed Shiny applications into the presentation, and I found this to be pretty cool.  There are Shiny apps on slides 5 and 6."

These are [the slides](https://tychobra.shinyapps.io/atlanta_r_users_presentation_2018_04_17/#5) from my presentation at the April Atlanta R User meetup.  

There are not many words on the slides, so you won't be able to follow the presentation by flipping through the slides.  I nonetheless wanted to share them because the presentation uses the ioslides Rmarkdown template to directly embed Shiny applications into the presentation.  There are Shiny apps on slides 5 and 6.  Here is [the code](https://github.com/Tychobra/tychobra_presentations/tree/master/atlanta_r_users_presentation_2018_04_17) used to create the presentation. 

The Shiny application on sheet 5 uses the `xgboost` R package to predict payments on individual insurance claims.  

The 2nd Shiny application, on sheet 6, uses the `keras` R package to predict the digit from images of handwritten digits.  This is a very simple deep learning application.

Slides 2 and 3 are pictures of my newly born niece!
