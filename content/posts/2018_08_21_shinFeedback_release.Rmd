intro: "The version 0.1.0 release brings snackbar notifications to the package.  Snackbars are useful for notifying a user that something has happened without getting in the users way.  For example you could show a 'Form Submitted Successfully' snackbar after the user clicks on a form's submit button.  The snackbar would display at the bottom of the page and fade after a few seconds."

Version 0.1.0 of the shinyFeedback package is now available on CRAN.  Your can install the latest version by running:

The `shinyFeedback` package makes it easy to display useful feedback notifications in Shiny apps.  Since the initial `shinyFeedback` CRAN release, it has been able to display short messages, icons, and color changes around several of the standard Shiny input bindings. For example:
