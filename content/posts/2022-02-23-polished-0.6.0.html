<p>The newest release of <code>polished</code>, 0.6.0, is now on CRAN. The biggest user
facing enhancement of this release is the new ability to secure R Markdown documents
using Polished Auth. The secured R Markdown output can be a static document, or it can use
the <code>shiny</code> runtime. We discussed this capability in more detail in
a <a href="https://www.tychobra.com/posts/2022-02-10-secure-rmd/">previous post here</a>.</p>
<p>Another welcome addition in this release is the ability to access each <code>polished</code> users’
data via the <code>session$user</code> object. By default, <code>polished</code> now passes the signed in
user’s data to <code>session$user</code>. This won’t break any of your existing <code>polished</code> Shiny apps as the
signed in user’s data will always still be available at <code>session$userData$user()</code> as it has been in all previous <code>polished</code> releases.</p>
<p><code>Polished</code> has historically stored the user’s data at this <code>session$userData$user()</code> location
because that is where <code>shiny</code> recommends <code>shiny</code> developers and
package authors store arbitrary user data. However, as long as you are not using an
Rstudio hosting option, <code>session$user</code> is usually unused, and, with <code>polished</code>, you can now use it as
an alias to <code>session$userData$user()</code>. If you need access to <code>session$user</code> as set by RStudio
Connect (or another RStudio hosting option), set the <code>override_user</code> argument of <code>polished_config()</code> to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>

<p>The largest change in this release was an internal refactor of many of the objects
and functions for managing Polished Auth. We switched from using a single large <code>R6</code>
class to a base R environment and regular R functions (rather than <code>R6</code> methods). This change was inspired by our development
efforts on a new package, <code>polishedpayments</code>. <code>polishedpayments</code> makes it easy to
add Stripe payments to your <code>polished</code> Shiny app. <code>polishedpayments</code> sits between
<code>polished</code> and your custom Shiny app. It needs to intercept the <code>polished</code> user and handle
the user based on your selected <code>polished</code> and <code>polishedpayments</code> options before passing the user along
to your Shiny app.</p>

<p>In our earlier development of <code>polishedpayments</code>, we were having difficulty
integrating <code>polishedpayments</code> with <code>polished</code>. After this refactor, the integration is much more seamless.
We plan to continue development on other R packages that similarly provide middleware between
the <code>polished</code> users and the your custom <code>polished</code> Shiny app. We will share more details on
<code>polishedpayments</code> and how you can write similar packages in upcoming blog posts. In the meantime,
the source code for <code>polishedpayments</code> can be found <a href="https://github.com/Tychobra/polishedpayments">here</a> &amp; the development version of
the package can be installed with <code>remotes::install_github(“Tychobra/polishedpayments”)</code>.</p>
<p>There are several other minor updates in this <code>polished</code> release. See the
<a href="https://github.com/Tychobra/polished/releases/tag/v0.6.0">release notes</a> for a full list of updates.</p>
