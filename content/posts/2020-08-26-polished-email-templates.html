<p>Polished is an R package that adds authentication and user administration to your Shiny apps. We are constantly working to make polished easier to set up and more useful (once set up).</p>
<p><img src="/posts/2020-08-26-polished-email-templates_files/polished_onboarding.png" /></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Most recently, we reworked the user invite flow to send email invites when inviting new users to your Shiny app. As a user of polished, you can send an email invite when you invite a user to your app. Your user can then click the email invite to be redirected to set their password. Your userâ€™s email will be automatically verified, and they will be redirected to your app. This is as simple as it gets for onboarding new users.</p>

<p>We also added customizable invite email templates. You can customize the emails your users receive when they are invited to new apps, verify their email address, and when they reset their password.</p>
