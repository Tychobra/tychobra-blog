tldr: You can now use <code>polished</code> to secure Rmarkdown documents that use the <code>shiny</code> runtime.  This includes flexdashboards!

For example, if you have a flexdashboard that uses <code>shiny</code>. e.g.

<div class = "col-12 text-center">
  <h3>Your Rmd Shiny App</h3>
  <img src="https://polished.tech/images/09_secure_rmd.png" width="100%"/>
</div>
<br/>

With a single function call, you can add an authentication layer with prebuilt sign in / registration pages, a user admin
dashboard, and many other features. Here is an example sign in page:

<div class = "col-12 text-center">
  <h3>Sign In Page</h3>
  <img src="https://polished.tech/images/07_alt_sign_in_ui.png" width = "100%"/>
</div>
<br/>

For a while now, polished users have able to use `polished` to secure traditional `shiny` apps and static documents, but `polished` 
did not support Rmarkdown documents using the <code>shiny</code> runtime (I'll
refer to Rmarkdown documents using the `shiny` runtime as "Shiny Rmds").  This was unfortunate as Shiny Rmds are popular, and, since the actual 
`shiny` app is generated behind the scenes by `rmarkdown`, adding authentication is not straightforward.  

Polished now allows you to secure you Shiny Rmd by calling the `polished::secure_rmd()` function.  Make sure you have the
development version of polished installed before trying it out.  You can install it with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("tychobra/polished")
```

Here is a full example:

- code: [https://github.com/Tychobra/polished_example_apps/tree/master/09_rmarkdown](https://github.com/Tychobra/polished_example_apps/tree/master/09_rmarkdown)
- live app: [https://demo9.polished.tech/](https://demo9.polished.tech/)

You can sign into the above live app with:

- email: demo@tychobra.com
- password: polished

The `polished::secure_rmd()` function takes the `shiny` app generated by the your Shiny Rmd, and wraps polished authentication
around it.  You can specify the arguments to `secure_rmd()` in your Shiny Rmd YAML header, or you can pass the arguments
to the `secure_rmd()` function directly.

You can then deploy your app anywhere you can host a regular `shiny` app, including Polished Hosting.  To deploy to Polished Hosting, use
the `polished::deploy_app()` function the same way you would deploy a regular `shiny` app.
