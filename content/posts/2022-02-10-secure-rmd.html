<p>tldr: You can now use <code>polished</code> to secure Rmarkdown documents that use the <code>shiny</code> runtime. This includes flexdashboards!</p>
<p>For example, if you have a flexdashboard that uses <code>shiny</code>. e.g.</p>
<div class="col-12 text-center">
<h3>
Your Rmd Shiny App
</h3>
<p><img src="https://polished.tech/images/09_secure_rmd.png" width="100%"/></p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With a single function call, you can add an authentication layer with prebuilt sign in / registration pages, a user admin
dashboard, and many other features. Here is an example sign in page:</p>
<div class="col-12 text-center">
<h3>
Sign In Page
</h3>
<p><img src="https://polished.tech/images/07_alt_sign_in_ui.png" width = "100%"/></p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For a while now, users have been able to use <code>polished</code> to secure traditional <code>shiny</code> apps and static documents, but <code>polished</code>
did not support Rmarkdown documents using the <code>shiny</code> runtime (I’ll
refer to Rmarkdown documents using the <code>shiny</code> runtime as “Shiny Rmds”). This was unfortunate as Shiny Rmds are popular, and, since the actual
<code>shiny</code> app is generated behind the scenes by <code>rmarkdown</code>, adding authentication to Shiny Rmds is not straightforward.</p>
<p>Polished now allows you to secure your Shiny Rmd by calling the <code>polished::secure_rmd()</code> function. Make sure you have the
development version of polished installed before trying it out. You can install it with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>remotes::install_github(&quot;tychobra/polished&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Here is a full example:</p>
<ul>
<li>code: <a href="https://github.com/Tychobra/polished_example_apps/tree/master/09_rmarkdown">https://github.com/Tychobra/polished_example_apps/tree/master/09_rmarkdown</a></li>
<li>live app: <a href="https://demo9.polished.tech/">https://demo9.polished.tech/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can sign into the above live app with:</p>
<ul>
<li>email: <a href="mailto:demo@tychobra.com" class="email">demo@tychobra.com</a></li>
<li>password: polished</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>polished::secure_rmd()</code> function takes the <code>shiny</code> app generated by the your Shiny Rmd and wraps <code>polished</code> authentication
around it. You can specify the arguments to <code>secure_rmd()</code> in your Shiny Rmd YAML header, or you can pass the arguments
to the <code>secure_rmd()</code> function directly.</p>
<p>You can then deploy your app anywhere you can host a regular <code>shiny</code> app, including <a href="https://polished.tech/docs/04-hosting-deploy-app">Polished Hosting</a>. To deploy to Polished Hosting, use
the <code>polished::deploy_app()</code> function the same way you would deploy a regular <code>shiny</code> app.</p>
