<p>tldr: You can now use polished to secure Rmarkdown documents that user the Shiny runtime. This includes
flexdashboards!</p>
<br/>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6 text-center">
<pre><code>&lt;h3&gt;Sign In Page&lt;/h3&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6 text-center">
<pre><code>&lt;h3&gt;Your Rmd Shiny App&lt;/h3&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For a while now, polished users have able to use polished to secure static documents, but polished
did not support Rmarkdown documents using the Shiny runtime. This was unfortunate as Shiny Rmarkdown/flexdashboards (I’ll
call them Shiny Rmds) are popular, are frequently R users’ first experience with Shiny, and, since the actual
Shiny app is generated behind the scenes by Rmarkdown, it is not straightforward how you can add an
authentication layer in front of your app.</p>
<p>Polished now allows you to secure you Shiny Rmd by calling the <code>polished::secure_rmd()</code> function. Make sure you have the
development version of polished installed before trying it out. You can install it with:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>remotes::install_github(&quot;tychobra/polished&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Here is a full example:</p>
<ul>
<li>code:</li>
<li>live app:</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>polished::secure_rmd()</code> function takes the Shiny app generated by the your Shiny Rmd, and wraps polished authentication
around it. You can specify the arguments to <code>secure_rmd()</code> in your Shiny Rmd YAML header, or you can pass the arguments
to the function directly.</p>
<p>You can then deploy your Shiny app anywhere you’d like, including Polished Hosting. To deploy to Polished Hosting, use
the <code>polished</code>::deploy_app()`, the same way you would deploy a regular Shiny app.</p>
