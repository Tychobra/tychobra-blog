intro: "The version 0.1.0 release brings snackbar notifications to the package.  Snackbars are useful for notifying a user that something has happened without getting in the users way.  For example you could show a 'Form Submitted Successfully' snackbar after the user clicks on a form's submit button.  The snackbar would display at the bottom of the page and fade after a few seconds."
