The newest, 0.6.0, release of <code>polished</code> is now on CRAN.  The biggest user
facing enhancement of this release is the new ability to secure R Markdown documents
using Polished Auth.  The secured R Markdown output can be a static document, or it can use 
the <code>shiny</code> runtime.  We discussed this capability in more detail in 
a [previous post here](https://www.tychobra.com/posts/2022-02-10-secure-rmd/).

Another welcome addition in this release is the ability to access the polished user's 
data via the `session$user` object.  By default, <code>polished</code> now passes the signed in
user's data to `session$user`.  This won't break any of you existing polished shiny apps as the signed in user's data will always still be available at `session$userData$user()` as it has been in all previous <code>polished</code> releases.  

<code>Polished</code> has historically stored the user's data at this `session$userData$user()` location 
because that is where <code>shiny</code> recommends <code>shiny</code> developers and
package authors store arbitrary user data.  However, as long as you are not using an 
Rstudio hosting option, the `session$user` is usually unused, and you can now use it as
an alias to `session$userData$user()`.  If you do need access the `session$user` as set by RStudio 
Connect (or another RStudio hosting option), set the "override_user" argument of `polished_config()` to `FALSE`.

The largest change in this release was an internal refactor of many of the objects 
and functions for managing Polished Auth.  We switched from using a single large <code>R6</code>
class to a base R environment and regular R functions (rather than `R6` methods).  This change was inspired by our development
efforts on a new package, <code>polishedpayments</code>.  <code>polishedpayments</code> makes it easy to 
add Stripe payments to your polished shiny app.  <code>polishedpayments</code> sits between 
<code>polished</code> and your custom Shiny app.  It needs to intercept the <code>polished</code> user and handle
the user based on your selected `polished` and `polishedpayments` options before passing the user along 
to your shiny app.

In our earlier development of <code>polishedpayments</code>, we were having difficulty 
integrating `polishedpayments` with `polished`.  After this refactor, the integration is much more seemless.
We hope other R packages will be developed in the future that similarly provide middleware between
the polished user and the custom shiny app.  We will share more detail on 
<code>polishedpayments</code> and how you can write similar packages in upcoming blog posts. Please
subscribe if you'd like to be notified when the posts are released.

There are several other minor updates in this realease.  See the [release notes](https://github.com/Tychobra/polished/releases/tag/v0.6.0) for a 
full list of updates.
