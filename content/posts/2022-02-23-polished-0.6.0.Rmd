The newest release of <code>polished</code>, 0.6.0, is now on CRAN.  The biggest user
facing enhancement of this release is the new ability to secure R Markdown documents
using Polished Auth.  The secured R Markdown output can be a static document, or it can use 
the <code>shiny</code> runtime.  We discussed this capability in more detail in 
a [previous post here](https://www.tychobra.com/posts/2022-02-10-secure-rmd/).

Another welcome addition in this release is the ability to access each <code>polished</code> users' 
data via the `session$user` object.  By default, <code>polished</code> now passes the signed in
user's data to `session$user`.  This won't break any of your existing <code>polished</code> Shiny apps as the 
signed in user's data will always still be available at `session$userData$user()` as it has been in all previous <code>polished</code> releases.  

<code>Polished</code> has historically stored the user's data at this `session$userData$user()` location 
because that is where <code>shiny</code> recommends <code>shiny</code> developers and
package authors store arbitrary user data.  However, as long as you are not using an 
RStudio hosting option, `session$user` is usually unused, and, with `polished`, you can now use it as
an alias to `session$userData$user()`.  If you need access to `session$user` as set by RStudio 
Connect (or another RStudio hosting option), set the `override_user` argument of `polished_config()` to `FALSE`.

The largest change in this release was an internal refactor of many of the objects 
and functions for managing Polished Auth.  We switched from using a single large <code>R6</code>
class to a base R environment and regular R functions (rather than `R6` methods).  This change was inspired by our development
efforts on a new package, <code>polishedpayments</code>.   <code>polishedpayments</code> makes it easy to 
add Stripe payments to your `polished` Shiny app.  <code>polishedpayments</code> sits between 
<code>polished</code> and your custom Shiny app.  It needs to intercept the <code>polished</code> user and handle
the user based on your selected `polished` and `polishedpayments` options before passing the user along 
to your Shiny app.

In our earlier development of <code>polishedpayments</code>, we were having difficulty 
integrating `polishedpayments` with `polished`.  After this refactor, the integration is much more seamless.
We plan to continue development on other R packages that similarly provide middleware between
the `polished` users and the your custom `polished` Shiny app.  We will share more details on 
<code>polishedpayments</code> and how you can write similar packages in upcoming blog posts. In the meantime, 
the source code for <code>polishedpayments</code> can be found [here](https://github.com/Tychobra/polishedpayments) & the development version of
the package can be installed with <code>remotes::install_github("Tychobra/polishedpayments")</code>.

There are several other minor updates in this `polished` release.  See the 
[release notes](https://github.com/Tychobra/polished/releases/tag/v0.6.0) for a full list of updates.
