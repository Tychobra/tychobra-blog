Implementing authentication from scratch is inefficient and increases the probability of security vulnerabilities.  Hand rolling custom logic to encrypt credentials, reset passwords, verify email addresses, etc. is a tedious, error-prone process.  Wouldn't it be nice if an R package handled this boilerplate code for you?

Yea, we thought so too.  That's why we created the <code>polished</code> R package.  <code>Polished</code> provides sign in and registration pages with all the accompanying bells and whistles your users expect from a modern web app.  Polished is secure, customizable to your brand, allows social sign in (with Google, Microsoft, and Facebook), and more. Check out all available features at <a href="https://polished.tech/">polished.tech</a> and try out <a href="https://tychobra.shinyapps.io/polished_example_01">a demo Shiny app using polished.tech here</a>. 

<code>Polished</code> has been available for installation from GitHub for about a year now.  Over this past year, the biggest drawback to using polished was that <code>polished</code> required a substantial level of effort and domain experience to setup and maintain.

With the introduction of polished.tech, <code>polished</code> is now much easier to setup, maintain, and update.  Before polished.tech, you had to provision a PostreSQL database and a <code>plumber</code> API to use <code>polished</code>.  With polished.tech, we host the database and API for you.  Enabling <code>polished</code> user authentication is now as easy as installing the <code>polished</code> R package, creating a polished.tech account, and copying and pasting a few lines of code.  Check out the <a href="https://polished.tech/docs/get-started">official getting started docs</a> for details.

I personally am extremely excited about polished.tech.  It has been a long time in the making.  It is free to create a polished.tech account, and there is a free tier for basic usage.  If you are looking for a modern authentication solution for your Shiny apps, I would be thrilled if you try out <a href="https://polished.tech/">polished.tech</a>.
