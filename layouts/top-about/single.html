                  Data quality presents the most substantial 
                  bottle neck to a productive analysis. Once data is properly organized, it is fairly 
                  easy to set up basic predictive models. We work to organize the data and then 
                  tweak and improve the models to gather insights that could never be 
                  achieved by a one off analysis.

                  The most important predictive model is the one that can be quickly run to produce
                  a meaningful result.  Working from a solid base, we fine tune our models to build familiarity with the 
                  problem.  We start simple and iterate on all predictive modeling, user interface 
                  design, and all general business models.

                  Spreadsheets are extremely powerful tools for exploratory data analysis, but they are abused

                  better option than a spreadsheet.

            Tycho Brahe was an eccentric 16th century astronomer who cared about his data.  He had a gold nose (literally, though not in his potrait) and an epic mustache (shown in portrait).  Tycho's meticulous data records led to discoveries that expanded humanity's understanding of the universe. 
          </p>
          <p className="pull-md-right">
            Tycho was able to make break through discoveries because he kept unprecedentedly accurate records of planetary orbits.  He used these records to make and support discoveries about supernovae and comets, but his life's grand goal was to discover a new model of the solar system.  Unfortunately for Tycho, his solar system model was wrong, but his methods of gathering data and testing hypotheses against the empirical data were the most advanced the world had ever seen.  
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>
        Johannes Kepler, a contemporary of Tycho, was also obsessed with decifering the laws governing the solar system.  Kepler unsuccessfully searched for these laws for many years until eventually Kepler got access to Tycho's data. Using Tycho's data, Kepler was able to come up with the 3 laws of planetary motion.  This was a big deal.  Kepler gets all the glory for the discovery, but it was Tycho's data that gave Kepler the context to construct his laws and the evidence to support his findings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lesson we take from Tycho Brahe is that data is the key.  Without accurate data you are searching in the dark, and even if you stumble upon something in the darkness it is impossible to share and build upon your findings.  If you track and organize your data, you can create models and test them against the data.  As the data continues to flow in you can continuously test and improve your models.  This emphasis on data gathering and quality underlies all of our work at Tychobra.
      </p>

        There is a whole lot more to Tycho's story.  He was a facinating person in general; he was exciled from Denmark and his nose was chopped off in a sword duel.  If you are interested, I highly recommend Tycho's Wikipedia page and this episode from the original Cosmos series:
